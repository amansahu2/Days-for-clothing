# Days-for-clothing

**Days for Clothing** is a major street-style fashion brand based in Dharavi, Mumbai, known for its bold designs and popularity among youth, influencers, and stylists. As the brand expands, the need for smarter data insights became vital to handle rising consumer demand and competition.

This project focuses on transforming the brand's data capabilities through interactive visualizations and predictive models built using Tableau.
##  Project Background

Despite using Excel and ERP integrations via iThinkLogistics and Shopify, the brand's data practices were inefficient. Our team developed three robust data visualization prototypes to help the company make more informed, timely, and strategic business decisions:

### 1. **Sales Dashboard**
Offers a real-time, comprehensive view of sales across product categories. Tracks trends, progress toward goals, and areas for improvement—enabling agile decision-making to drive revenue growth.

### 2. **Customer Insights & Activity Dashboard**
Analyzes customer behavior and preferences across touchpoints to discover purchasing trends. Helps personalize marketing campaigns and strengthen customer loyalty.

### 3. **Predictive Analytics**
Employs forecasting models to predict future purchase behavior, especially around denim demand. Enhances inventory planning and prepares the business for market shifts and potential disruptions.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Tableau** – For interactive dashboards and data visualization
- **Excel** – Initial data cleaning and transformation
- **Shopify + iThinkLogistics ERP** – Source systems for sales and customer data
- **Calculated Fields, Parameters, Filters** – To power dynamic exploration in dashboards

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amansahu2/Days-for-clothing.git
Open the Tableau workbook (.twbx) in Tableau Desktop.

Navigate through the dashboards to explore sales, customer insights, and predictive analysis.
